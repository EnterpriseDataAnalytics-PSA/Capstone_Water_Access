		        <h2>The most water for the most people</h2>
                <p>Around the world, nearly 25% of communal water access points are non-functional.
		        This challenge has been difficult to address at a global, national, or even local level due to a severe scarcity of data.
		        Consequently, the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx) has created a harmonized data exchange standard for water point data
		        and supported the development of a global repository.</p>
			    <p>We aim to use the WPDx data to create a web-based portal that will help governments manage water access in their countries.</p>

          <p>Our goal is to create four tools that will enable governments to make evidence-based decisions at the click of a button.</p>

          <p>Collectively, the tools should give government officials a comprehensive view of water access across their respective countries, thereby empowering them to efficiently allocate resources towards areas of greatest need.</p>
